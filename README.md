# CivicFix 

**CivicFix** is a civic engagement platform designed to streamline communication between citizens and municipal authorities. It allows individuals to easily report local issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, garbage accumulation, water leakage, and more—right from their devices. By digitizing and centralizing civic complaints, CivicFix promotes transparency, accountability, and faster resolutions.

This platform not only empowers residents to be active participants in city development but also provides administrators with a powerful dashboard to manage, prioritize, and resolve reported issues efficiently. Each report includes descriptions, status updates, timestamps, and images, ensuring clear and continuous communication between the public and the government.

Whether it’s a broken lamp post or a sanitation issue, **CivicFix** is your go-to civic grievance redressal tool.
